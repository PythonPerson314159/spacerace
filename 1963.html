<h5>Mercury-Atlas 9</h5>
<hr>
<p>
Mercury-Atlas 9 (MA-9, for short) was a manned orbital mission by the USA. Interestingly, this is the last time that an American was launched into orbit alone. This sole astronaut was Leroy Gordon Cooper Jr., a member of the Mercury Seven, a group of seven astronauts selected to fly the spacecraft in Project Mercury. Some people at NASA thought that the previous Mercury mission was so perfect, that they should just call it there and quit while they were ahead, but the JSC (Johnson Space Center), motivated by the Soviets' many successes, pushed for a full-day attempt. After a minor delay, MA-9 was launched from, unsurprisingly, Cape Canaveral, Florida, at 8 am EST on May 15th.

The craft, nicknamed Faith 7 by Gordon himself, slipped into orbit after only a few minutes, with the lone astronaut beginning his experiments at the start of the third 89-minute orbit. During his scheduled rest period, starting at orbit nine, he was reportedly not tired, and instead captured some aerial photos of Tibet, among other things. After a rather uneventful few hours, on orbit 19 of the scheduled 22, the altitude reading was lost. On the descent, he instead tracked the altitude by eye, and luckily all was well.
