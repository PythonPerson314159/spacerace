<h2>October 4, 1959</h2>
<h5>Luna 3</h5>
<hr>
<p>
Luna 3 was the third Soviet mission in the Moon's vicinity, and had two major new firsts, which I'll go through soon. This mission launched from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in modern-day Kazakhstan right after midnight, with a solar powered probe launched from a Luna 8K72 rocket. Soaring over our north pole, it passed over the Moon's south at its closest approach 60 hours later.
<br><br>
The day after, on the 7th of October, it took the very first photos of the far side of the Moon from 65-69 thousand kilometres away, after thousands of years of us humans staring at our half of its surface. Due to us being unable to transmit the radio signals through the trillions of tons of moon rock, the probe stored them until the 18th of October. With academician Mstislav Keldysh's assistance, this probe used the gravity assist maneuver to try and redirect the craft towards Earth using the Moon's gravity.
<br><br>
Sadly, we lost contact with it on the 22nd, a mere four days after the pictures of the moon's far side were shot, and another four days later, the Soviets officially released the photos, however, only 17 of the 29 taken could be retrieved. A few months later, on April 29th, 1960, the craft decayed.
