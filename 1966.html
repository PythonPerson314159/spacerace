<h2>February 3, 1966</h2>
<h5>Luna 9 & ESSA-1</h5>
<hr>
<p>
This day just so happened to have two space race events occur - America's ESSA-1 launched and the USSR's Luna 9 landed. I'll go into each event, starting with Luna 9.
<br>
<br>
Luna 9 was an unmanned Soviet mission to the Moon (as the name suggests), and the first ever spacecraft to achieve a soft landing on it, as opposed to crashing. The craft itself, the Luna E-6, was designed by Sergei Korolev, who sadly died just a few weeks before his brainchild's launch. Ironically, the craft would soon die as well, but I'll speak more about that later.
<br><br>
Launch went smoothly, and in due time, on the 3rd of February, Luna 9 bounced a few times before coming to softly rest on the surface of the moon, rather close to where its predecessor, Luna 8, had crashed months earlier. On the surface, apart from doing the standard scientific routines you'd imagine, such as measuring radiation, and confirming that the lunar dust wasn't like quicksand and could support craft, they also did something much more publically appealing. They attached a camera to the spacecraft, and opened the shutter to take the very first photos from the moon's surface.
<br><br>
The scientists got the radio signals that represented the photos back, but Soviet authorities kept it secret from the public. Interestingly, some British scientists tracking the mission also recieved said signals, and noticed that it used a format identical to the international standard for newspapers. They had the Daily Express rush over a reciever, and they pubilshed them prematurely, on February 5, which the Soviets complained about. As for the craft's death, we had our last contact with it the followng day, leaving it stranded on the Moon forever.
<br><br>
As for ESSA-1, it was the start of America's ESSA program, which was an extension of the successful TIROS program. Said TIROS program launched the first ever meteorological satellite in 1960. As for this mission, the spacecraft used was an 18-sided polygon covered with thousands of solar cells, and launched from, you guessed it, Cape Canaveral, Florida. It collected cloud covered photography of the United States for 861 days before its deactivation.
