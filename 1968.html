<h5>Apollo 6</h5>
<hr>
<p>
Apollo 6 was an unmanned Apollo mission which was being used as a "qualification" for the planned manned missions for future Apollos. It's a good thing they did this one, as they found not one, not two, but THREE flaws in this mission.
<br><br>
Firstly, there was a severe "pogo oscillation", which is caused by combustion instability and can cause damage to the rocket's frame. This would both cause major discomfort for astronauts on board, but also created the second issue, a loss of structural panels. Lastly, and most majorly, two out of the five second stage engines shut down prematurely. This only resulted in the orbit being 16km tighter than planned, due to the remaining three second stage engines as well as all of the third stage ones burning for longer than needed to compensate for that.
<br><br>
Another issue arose from all of this - the third stage simply did not restart, but still did the maneuver that assumed it had restarted. This led to the lunar reentry simulation taking place at 36,000km/h, instead of 40,000km/h. Ten hour after launch, it splashed down 80 km off target, north of Hawaii. Apollo Program Director Samuel Phillips later said that it was a "less than perfect mission", but even reaching orbit with these conditions was a "major unplanned accomplishment".
