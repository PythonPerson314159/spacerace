<h5>Vanguard 1</h5>
<hr>
<p>
Vanguard 1 was America's 2nd satellite launch, six weeks after Explorer 1, the first. It was built by the Naval Research Laboratory, a branch of the U.S. Navy, upon being tasked to build a satellite for the International Geophysical Year. This craft was absolutely tiny, too - only 15 centimetres in diameter, and weighing a microscopic 1.4 kilograms! In fact, Nikita Khrushchev, the Soviet Premier at the time, described it as "the grapefruit satellite".
<br>
<br>
Additionally, this was the first ever solar powered satellite, starting a very useful and efficient trend. It launched at 12:15 GMT from Cape Canaveral, Florida, at a steady rate of an orbit every 2 1/4 hours. It achieved ALL of its scientific objectives, and then some, proving that the Earth has a slight bulge around 40 degrees south, and that the atmosphere is much more extensive than we thought. Sadly, we lost contact with it six years later in 1964, but 68 years and over 14 billion kilometres later, it's still peacefully rotating around our planet in its elliptical orbit.
